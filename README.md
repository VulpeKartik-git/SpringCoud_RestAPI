# SpringCoud_RestAPI

Spring Boot REST API with Spring Cloud Config

Overview:
This project is a robust Spring Boot REST API integrated with Spring Cloud Config for efficient configuration management. By connecting to a Git repository, the API fetches and manages configuration details dynamically. This setup enables streamlined configuration changes across different environments, ensuring adaptability and scalability.

Key Features:
Spring Cloud Config Integration: Utilized Spring Cloud Config to externalize and centralize configuration details for the REST API.
Git Repository Connection: Linked the project to a Git repository for versioned configuration storage and easy updates.
Environment-specific Configurations: Configured different environments (prod, dev, qa) for flexible deployment.
Dynamic Configuration Updates: Ensured the REST API adapts dynamically to configuration changes fetched from the cloud.

Dependencies:
spring-cloud-config-server: Facilitates the centralization of configuration management.
spring-boot-starter-test: Enables effective testing of the Spring Boot REST API.

How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Configure the Spring Cloud Config properties in the application.
Connect the project to your Git repository for centralized configuration management.
Run the Spring Boot application to experience dynamic configuration updates based on the environment.

Achievements:
Enhanced Configurability: Achieved a modular and easily maintainable REST API through externalized configurations.
Streamlined Deployment: Configured environments for production, development, and QA, ensuring consistent behavior in different deployment scenarios.
Git-based Versioning: Leveraged Git for version control of configuration files, allowing for easy rollback and change tracking.

Future Improvements that will be added:
Explore additional Spring Cloud features for advanced microservices configuration management.
Implement security measures to protect sensitive configuration data.
